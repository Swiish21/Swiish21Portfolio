            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <h2>2010 was the first time I was exposed to computers and tech, from the first time I booted up that very old macintosh computer, liitle did I know that computers would  become a part of my life. I was facinated by how they work and became more eager to know how to get better at using them. The years passed and my knowledge grew, I was hooked.

            I decided to try my hand at python in 2022 and tumbled head first in to the vast rabbit hole of programming. Fast forward to today, and I've had the privilege of building softwares for various well established and startup companies.My main focus nowadays is building pixel perfect, engaging and accessible digital experiences. Things that look good but are also built well under the hood.

            When I'm not at the computer,I'm usually playing basketball, playing video-games or hanging out with like minded people, generally I am a very fun guy!
